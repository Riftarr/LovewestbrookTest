    content="We're that church on Main Street in Westbrook that you often see meeting needs in our community. Why? 
    Because we believe that Grace compels us and activates us to love and serve. We don't do politics. We don't carry picket signs. 
    We follow the Jesus of the Bible and do our best to emulate his character, his personality and his style. Worship style is contemporary, relaxed, informal. ">

  <div class="missionStatement">
    <p>
      <br>
      At FBC Westbrook, our goal is simply-stated: we aim to love God with all that we are,
      love people wherever and hower we can (all people) and try to live like Jesus, the actual Jesus of the
      Bible, in our daily lives. Jesus said that all the Law and the Prophets, the entire Bible, boils down these
      things.
      <br><br>
      When you visit in person, you will see that our style is relaxed and informal. We don't major in flawless
      production or tons of programs but, instead, focus our energies on serving in our community and bringing
      Light and Hope. Grace compels us to serve. Come see if we're the place for you. If not, we'll try to help you find
      your fit in one of the other many great churches in our area.

      <h4>ABOUT US</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">We are a Grace-saturated community of messy people trying to navigate life by getting
        to know Jesus more. Today, we are a faith community of around 100-150 people. Our numbers include young
        families, singles, college students, empty nesters and grandparents. That means we have people just like
        you. As much as practical, we like to all gather together for worship from&nbsp; youngest to oldest,
        rather than segment everyone by age. <i><a href="./aboutus.html">more</a></i>

      </a>
      <h4>MAKING A DIFFERENCE&nbsp;</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">We do our best to maintain an outward focus rather than become ingrown. Our
        faith demands that we do whatever we can, wherever we can and whenever we can, with whatever we have, to
        try to make a difference and make life-changing, true connections with the people around us. FBC
        Westbrook is very active and visible locally and involved internationally, sponsoring a school in
        Guatemala. <i><a href="./ministries.html">more</a></i>

      <h4>WELCOMING NEW MAINERS</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">We welcome our new neighbors and do all we can to help them get settled. God's Peace
        Assembly, speaking English, French, Portuguese and Lingala, gathers for worship on Sunday afternoons. Our
        furniture ministry helps our brothers and sisters get their new apartments set up with beds, couches,
        tables, chairs and kitchen needs. Our afternoon and morning congregations partner in serving the
        community. <i><a href="./GPA/GPA-index.html">more</a></i>

      <h4>RELEVANT MESSAGES</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">Are you looking for a church that is more academic in approach or more focused on
        addressing today's challenges? Our Sunday morning messages focus on being topical, relevant teachings from
        Scripture that you can apply immediately but we strongly believe academic, knowledg- giving teachings are
        vital to maturing Christians. We hope our class offerings, LifeGroups and book studies, in addition to our
        main Sunday gathering, will help you dig deep.

      <h4>WE DON'T PASS A PLATE</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">Are you thinking that churches only care about money? At FBC Westbrook we don't even
        pass a plate. Giving is available online and in person for those who understand that God invites us to
        partner in ministry through giving of our time, treasure and talent. If you want to support what God is
        doing through our local gathering, <a href="https://easytithe.com/fbcwestbrook">we invite you to give by
          clicking here</a>. You can also mail your gift or drop it in the plate at a gathering.

      <h4>LISTEN OR WATCH ONLINE&nbsp;</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">Did you miss a message or want to get caught up on a series? We post all our past
        messages online <a href="messages.html">here in our audio vault</a>. If you
        prefer to watch past messages, visit our Facebook page.
        While it's so easy to stay home and watch or listen at your convenience, we encourage you to come out and
        join with others whenever possible. We are stronger together. Each of us has a role to play.

      <h4>JOIN A LIFEGROUP</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">LifeGroups are where life happens. Our main focus in our LifeGroups is relationship.
        The Christian word is "fellowship" but, over the years, that word has lost its meaning. The Greek word
        "koinonia", translated "fellowship," implied more of true, connecting friendships where we feel
        comfortable sharing the ups and downs of life as we grow closer to Jesus.&nbsp; Our LifeGroups focus in on
        our Sunday morning topics and dig a little bit deeper but are not the traditional bible study format. If
        you are interested in joining, or hosting, a LifeGroup and building true friendships email
        info@lovewestbrook.org.

      <h4>CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS</h4>

      <p class="gallery-card-text">We disagree with those who say that children are the church of the future. We believe
        children are just as much a part of the church of today as adults are! At FBC Westbrook we work to welcome
        children in our worship gatherings and include them. Then, when it comes time for the teaching part of our
        gathering, our children take part in a fun bible story and activities designed just for them.&nbsp; Our
        approach is like a one-room schoolhouse for ages 3-10, with the oldest kids helping the youngest. We use
        the same COVID policies as area schools.
